# MJC School

## Who we are?

We are EPAM employees who drive MJC School initiative. We donâ€™t build our initiative from scratch: it is based on the EPAM Training Center experience and production people collaboration.

## What we do?

We do Java juniors education. We call current education run - pilot run, because we still keep Java Laboratory education flow but with some changes.

Previously we had plan to make our Java education public and community based. We still have such plan for September.

But the situation has changed. We need to proceed and not stop Java education but do it in new reality with online world and unpredictable vacancies demand.

## How we are going to proceed?

* Take possible number of students for the pilot run
* Involve production people for mentoring and content work
* Create mentor and mentee pairs
* Keep active communication
* Provide and get feedbacks
