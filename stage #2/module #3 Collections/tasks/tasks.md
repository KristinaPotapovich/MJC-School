## Java Collection Tasks

## List
1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in an ArrayList containing the days of the week (strings).
2. Write a Java program to insert a string "MJC" into the ArrayList at the second and last positions.
3. Write a Java program to copy one ArrayList into another.
4. Write a Java program to iterate a LinkedList in reverse order.
5. Write a Java program to add 1 000 000 elements to ArrayList and LinkedList. Measure the time spent. Compare the results and return 1 if the time spent for ArrayList is greater, -1 if less, 0 if equal.

## Set
1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a HashSet.
2. Write a Java program to clone a HashSet to another hash set.
3. Write a Java program to compare two sets and retain elements which are same on both sets.
4. Write a Java program to create a new TreeSet, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the tree set.
5. Write a Java program to find the numbers less than 10 in a given TreeSet.

## Queue
1. Write a Java program to create a new priority queue, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the elements of the priority queue.
2. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in priority queue.
3. Write a Java program to add all the elements of a priority queue to another priority queue.
4. Write a Java program to convert a priority queue to an array containing all of the elements of the queue.

## Map
1. Write a Java program to test if a map contains a key for the specified value.
2. Write a Java program to get a collection view of the values contained in the given map.
3. Write a Java program to get a set view of the keys contained in the given map.
4. Write a Java program to sort keys in a TreeMap<String, Integer> by the length of the key (DESC).
5.  *Write a Java program that takes a Map <K, V> as input and returns a Map where the keys and values are swapped.

## Combined
1. Write a Java program that takes an array of String elements as an input and returns Map <String, Integer>, where String is the value from the array and Integer is the number of entries in the array.
2. Write an Iterator over an array.
3. Write a Java program to build a frequency dictionary of the letters of the English alphabet.
