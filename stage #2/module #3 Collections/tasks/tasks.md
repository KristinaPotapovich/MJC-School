## Java Collection Tasks

## List
1. Write a method to iterate through all elements in an ArrayList containing the days of the week (strings). The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to insert a string "MJC" into the ArrayList at the third (counting from 1) and last positions. The ArrayList should initially contain "String1", "String2", "String3". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to copy one ArrayList into another (copy list2 into list1). The first List should contain "1", "2", "3", "4". The second List should contain "A", "B", "C", "D". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list1, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to iterate a LinkedList containing the days of the week (strings) in reverse order. The method should return a string containing the elements of the list in reverse order, separated by a space.
5. Write a method that adds 1 000 000 elements to ArrayList and LinkedList then gets a random element from the filled lists by index 1 000 times. Measure the time spent. Compare the results and return 1 if the time spent for ArrayList is greater, -1 if less, 0 if equal.

## Set
1. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a HashSet.
2. Write a Java program to clone a HashSet to another hash set.
3. Write a Java program to compare two sets and retain elements which are same on both sets.
4. Write a Java program to create a new TreeSet, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the tree set.
5. Write a Java program to find the numbers less than 10 in a given TreeSet.

## Queue
1. Write a Java program to create a new priority queue, add all the days of the week (string) and print out the elements of the priority queue.
2. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in priority queue.
3. Write a Java program to add all the elements of a priority queue to another priority queue.
4. Write a Java program to convert a priority queue to an array containing all of the elements of the queue.

## Map
1. Write a Java program to test if a map contains a key for the specified value.
2. Write a Java program to get a collection view of the values contained in the given map.
3. Write a Java program to get a set view of the keys contained in the given map.
4. Write a Java program to sort keys in a TreeMap<String, Integer> by the length of the key (DESC).
5.  *Write a Java program that takes a Map <K, V> as input and returns a Map where the keys and values are swapped.

## Combined
1. Write a Java program that takes an array of String elements as an input and returns Map <String, Integer>, where String is the value from the array and Integer is the number of entries in the array.
2. Write an Iterator over an array.
3. Write a Java program to build a frequency dictionary of the letters of the English alphabet.
